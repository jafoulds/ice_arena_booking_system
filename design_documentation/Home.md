**Project:** Iceman

**Team:** Seal Team 6

**Overview**

Project Iceman is a web application that supports scheduled bookings and maintenance scheduling for an ice rink complex. Community groups and pick-up hockey clubs can use the system to book rink time for multiple rinks, as well as review bookings, and notify group members of booking changes or other updates. A single user can be responsible for multiple groups, where each group can have multiple bookings.
