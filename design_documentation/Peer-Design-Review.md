Meeting with another project team that was designing a system for the same client with the same set of requirements proved to be an extremely valuable learning experience. It facilitated an excellent exchange of differing views on the system design and provided an objective evaluation of each team’s project from another set of people with a deep understanding of the problem. As a result of this meeting, we have identified some key design problems that we recommend Team #10 take into consideration when moving forward in their project.

### Design Problems

In the problem description, the client notes that, “community groups or pick-up hockey clubs can use the system to both book rink time and also find out what they have already booked.” From the other team’s design document and discussion, it was evident that their system only allows bookings by single users and has no concept of “groups” implemented into their system design. Therefore, only a single person could create bookings for a group as opposed to any member of that group. In addition, a user that represents multiple groups would then have to create an account for each group they represent, which would be extremely inconvenient for any user. Consider for example a youth hockey league coach who’s responsible for booking rink time for every team in the league - without the concept of both group & individual users, the coach would need to register a new login/password for every team.

Another issue was that when a user is looking for available time slots to book, the system requires the user to choose a specific rink. Once that is completed, the system will generate all the available time slots for that particular rink. This seems counterintuitive as hockey rinks are usually standardized so in most circumstances, the user does not care which rink they book in the arena complex. They are usually are only concerned that they book a rink in that particular arena complex at a given time. A problem that can arise with this design decision is that when a user wants to book a rink at a specific time, they will have to query each rink in the arena complex until they find an opening. As opposed to just making a single query with just a start time and letting the system find an opening amongst all the rinks. 

Team #10’s proposed system also featured a public facing calendar from which anyone accessing the website can view. Although this maximizes accessibility to the arena complex’s schedule, it also creates concerns for privacy as it allows access to users who are not even registered in the system. For example, in an extreme case, would you want everyone with an internet connection to know when there is a children’s skate going on? Most likely not.
