# Marking Guide    / 40

# Interim Mark 17/25

# Product Requirements 2/5 
This is about meeting the requirements identified in the problem statement. 

- You only implemented 2 or 3 use cases. There is no manager function.
- I realize you had merge problems, but you *have* to deliver for a client meeting.

# Product Quality 3/5
This is about the content of the pitch.

- You had a few bugs in your demo. The UI was fine, but nothing amazing. 

# Technical Briefing 8/10
This is about the content of the technical portion of the pitch. Every team member should expect to be asked about the technical details of the project. Sample question: "how is this controller wired to this view".

- At least a few of you could explain the design. You seem to get what Spring is doing. You have only deployed locally. 
- The database aspect is largely taken care of for you.

# Presentation "Pitch" Marks 4/5
This is about the professionalism and presentation of your pitch and tech brief.

- the slides are boring. As a client, I know the requirements. Focus on the live demo. I **Have** to sit through it - but venture capitalists, other funders, etc. won't bother.
- you did a good job organizing the demo, and while boring, the slides were evidence you had prepared. People seemed to know their roles. 

# Code and Design Quality /15
Note that you have until Friday before the code quality gets marked. NB: Many of the items here can be 'tested' with BetterCodeHub. In other words, a low BCH score will be a negative signal for me about this aspect.


- clarity and maintainability of the code (organization, packaging, class size)
- documentation is useful and present throughout
- code has unit tests
- code shows evidence of design principles such as SOLID, Design Patterns used where appropriate
- language and frameworks chosen are used properly (e.g. following Python idioms like list comprehensions)
- no obvious design smells like God Class, lack of refactoring, helpful names

# Bonus 0/12.5 (project: 5%)
- I don't see any evidence of this.

# Other comments
In all, we felt it was a bit of a lackluster approach to the project. Whether you just had trouble integrating all the features, or didn't put much time in, I think it could have been more compelling.
